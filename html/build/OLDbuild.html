    <p>To access the specifications of the GlobalDCE protocol, you can refer to the dedicated "GlobalDCE Protocol" section. However, it is important to have a solid understanding of GlobalDCE concepts beforehand. This section aims to provide a formal and easily understandable specification of the core GlobalDCE protocol.</p>
    <p>Note that to test the go code provided here you must first create a go module and and do go get github.com/globaldce/globaldce-gateway as follows:</p>
    <p>go mod init example.com/m</p>
    <p>go get github.com/globaldce/globaldce-gateway</p>
    <h2>GlobalDCE Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Proof of Work</h3>
    <p>Proof of Work (PoW) is a cryptographic puzzle that ensures a party has invested a certain amount of effort. In the GlobalDCE mainchain mining process, a PoW system similar to Nakamoto's proof of work is incorporated. It possesses two key properties: firstly, it guarantees that the party presenting the proof of work has exerted a predefined level of effort to create it, and secondly, the proof can be efficiently verified. Typically, solving a PoW puzzle is a probabilistic process, with the success probability depending on the predefined difficulty.</p>
    
    <p>Consider Alice and Bob as two parties engaging in communication. Alice can request Bob to perform a specific amount of computational work for each message he sends. To achieve this, Alice can ask Bob to provide a string that, when hashed, meets a predefined structure. Finding such a string entails a certain success probability, which determines the average amount of work Bob needs to invest in order to find a valid solution.</p>
    
    <p>In the GlobalDCE proof of work, the hashing algorithm employed is double-SHA3-256 (SHA3-256(SHA3-256)) and the predefined structure requires the resulting hash to be less than or equal to a target value, denoted as Target.</p>

	package main
	import (
		"github.com/globaldce/globaldce-gateway/applog"
		"github.com/globaldce/globaldce-gateway/utility"
		"github.com/globaldce/globaldce-gateway/mainchain"
		"time"
	)

	func main() {

		//--------------------------------------------------
		// testing genesis block ---------------------------
		//--------------------------------------------------

		applog.Init(".")
		applog.EnableDisplayTrace()

		testgenesisblock:=mainchain.GenesisBlock()
		applog.Trace("Genesis block %x ",testgenesisblock)

		targetbigint:=utility.BigIntFromCompact(testgenesisblock.Header.Bits)
		applog.Trace("%d target ",targetbigint)
		applog.Trace("check block hash computation %t ",testgenesisblock.CheckHash())
		applog.Trace("%d hash value ",utility.BigIntFromHash(&testgenesisblock.Header.Hash))

    <p>This simple evaluation allows for quick verification of the nonce's validity.</p>
    
    <h3>Merkle Trees:</h3>
    <p>Merkle trees, named after Ralph Merkle, enable efficient verification of data integrity using binary hash trees. The leaves of the tree are computed as hashes over data blocks, while higher-level nodes are computed by concatenating and hashing their respective children.</p>
    
    <p>In the previously discussed example, we assumed a scenario where the number of data blocks is a power of two, resulting in a complete binary tree. However, in cases where nodes are missing, certain measures need to be taken to maintain the tree's structure. Here a simple method is employed. When constructing a row in the tree (except for the root), if there is an odd number of nodes, the last node is duplicated. As a result, every intermediate row in the tree always contains an even number of nodes, ensuring that each node (except the leaves) has exactly two children.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, when there are only three data blocks, and the computation of the fourth node in the second-to-last row lacks a child, the last node is duplicated, and the computation proceeds as in the previous example. The same rule is applied whenever an odd number of nodes occurs at any other point during the computation.</p>

    <h3>Architecture:</h3>
    <p>At the core of GlobalDCE's architecture lies a public ledger known as the blockchain, which chronologically stores all processed transactions.<p>
	<div class="codediv">
	<pre><code class="language-go">
	From https://github.com/globaldce/globaldce-gateway/blob/main/mainchain/mainblock.go

	type Mainblock struct {
		Height uint32
		Header Mainheader
		Transactions [] utility.Transaction
	}

	type Mainheader struct {
		Version int32
		Prevblockhash utility.Hash
		Roothash utility.Hash
		Timestamp int64
		Bits uint32
		Nonce uint32
		Hash utility.Hash
	}
	</code></pre> 
	</div> 
<p>Version:</p>
<p>The version field stores the numerical value indicating the block format version. Currently, the block format version is 1, and blocks of any other version are neither relayed nor mined.</p>

<p>Prevblockhash:</p>
<p>This field holds the reference to the previous block.</p>

<p>To calculate the Prevblockhash, a double-SHA3-256 hash is performed on the concatenation of all elements in the previous block header:</p> 
<p> double-SHA3-256( Version || Prevblockhash || Roothash || Timestamp || Bits || Nonce ) </p>

<p>The reference acts as a link in the blockchain, establishing a chronological order for blocks and the transactions they contain.</p>

<p>Roothash:</p>
<p>This field stores the root of the Merkle hash tree. It ensures the integrity of all transactions included in the block. The parameters used for computing the tree are double-SHA256 as the hashing algorithm, and raw transactions serve as the data blocks.</p>

<p>Time:</p>
<p>The time field stores the timestamp in UNIX format, representing the approximate time of block creation. Since the timestamp is a parameter involved in block mining, it is fixed at the beginning of the mining process.</p>

<p>Bits:</p>
<p>The Bits field stores a compact representation of a target value T used in the proof-of-work puzzle. The target value is a 256-bit number, but its compact representation is only 32 bits long and encoded with 8 hex digits. The target value can be derived from its compact hexadecimal representation.</p>

<p>The very first block, the genesis block, was mined using the maximum target. To ensure a constant rate of one block per 10 minutes throughout the network, the target T is recalculated every 2016 blocks. This recalculation is based on the sum of time (t sum) it took to mine the last 2015 blocks, accounting for an off-by-one error.</p>

<p>Note that t sum is calculated as the difference between the timestamps (Time) in the block header.</p>

<p>Nonce:</p>
<p>The nonce field contains arbitrary data and is used as a source of randomness for solving the proof-of-work problem. However, due to its small size of 4 bytes, it may not provide sufficient variation to find a solution.</p>
	<div class="codediv">
	<pre><code class="language-go">
	From https://github.com/globaldce/globaldce-gateway/blob/main/utility/transaction.go

	type TxOut struct {
		Value uint64 // in milion globals
		Bytecode []byte
	}
	type TxIn struct {
		Hash Hash
		Index uint32
		Bytecode []byte
		Signature []byte
	}

	type Transaction struct {
		Version int32
		Vin []TxIn
		Vout []TxOut
	}
	</code></pre>  
	</div>

<p>Transactions:</p>
<p>There are two types of transactions: reward transactions and regular transactions. Reward transactions are special transactions that introduce new GlobalDCE coins into the system. They are included as the first transaction in every block and serve as a reward for solving the proof-of-work puzzle. On the other hand, regular transactions are used to transfer existing globaldce between different users/dapps. From an architectural perspective, a reward transaction can be considered a special case of a regular transaction. Therefore, we will discuss the structure of a regular transaction first, followed by the differences between reward and regular transactions.</p>

<p>Regular Transactions:</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, each block in the blockchain contains a set of transactions. A transaction consists of a transaction version (Version), a vector of inputs (Vin), and a vector of outputs (Vout), with the count of inputs and outputs specified beforehand.</p>
