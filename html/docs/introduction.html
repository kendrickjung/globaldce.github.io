  <h2>The Problem: </h2>
  <h2>The Solution: Enabling non deterministic primitives</h2>
    
    <h3><br>Globaldce native cryptocurrency<br></h3>
    <p2>Globaldce coins are created and managed according to a protocol that rewards agents (called "miners") who have processed transactions. 
      These miners use their computing power to verify, secure and record transactions in the globaldce blockchain. The name blockchain 
      comes from the fact that the basic entity of globaldce is called a block, and that the blocks are then linked into a chain, the blockchain.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>For each new block accepted, the verification-securing-registration activity, called mining, is remunerated by newly created globaldce coins 
      and by the fees of the transactions processed. As a currency or commodity, globaldce coins can be exchanged for other currencies or commodities, 
      goods or services. The cryptocurrency exchange rate is set on specialized marketplaces and fluctuates according to the law of supply and demand.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>It is possible to buy globaldce coins online on specialized platforms, physical terminals or in exchange for any good or service with a person 
      who already has them (the transaction can be done from smartphone to smartphone). The platforms also make it possible to follow in real time 
      the evolution of the price of globaldce coins compared to other currencies or cryptocurrencies.<br><br></p2>
