Introducing GlobalDCE v0.1 Alpha Release

We are thrilled to announce the initial release of GlobalDCE!

***********

Currently, the software is available exclusively for Windows users.

Download link: globaldce-gateway-0.1.1.zip

To get started, follow these steps:
1. Extract the files into a chosen directory.
2. Launch GLOBALDCE-GATEWAY.EXE.
3. The software will automatically establish connections with other nodes.

Your contribution to the network is invaluable if you can maintain a running node that accepts incoming connections.

Please note that this software is still in the alpha stage and considered experimental. There is a possibility that the system's state may need to be restarted if required. However, extensive efforts have been made to incorporate extensibility and versioning.

You can acquire coins by receiving them from others or by enabling CPU MINING to run a node and generate blocks. Initially, the proof-of-work difficulty has been deliberately set to an easy level, allowing a typical PC to generate coins in just a few hours during the initial phase. However, the difficulty will increase significantly as competition rises and automatic adjustments take effect. Coins generated must wait for 150 blocks to mature before they can be spent.

The total circulation of coins will reach 21,000,000,000,000. These coins will be distributed to network nodes when they create blocks, with the amount halving every 4 years, as follows:

First 4 years: 10,500,000,000,000 coins
Next 4 years: 5,250,000,000,000 coins
Subsequent 4 years: 2,625,000,000,000 coins
Following 4 years: 1,312,500,000,000 coins

Once this allocation is exhausted, the system will support transaction fees as a means of sustenance.
